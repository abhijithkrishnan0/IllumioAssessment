# Illumio Technical Assessment

## Project Structure

The project is mainly written in Java. I have used python for scripting to generate log files and the lookup table. These scripts can be found under the "scripts" directory.

## Assumptions

Below are the assumptions that I have made.

* For the second output file, I have assumed that the mentioned port is the destination port.
* If there is a csv entry  

## Usage

To run the application execute the below commands.   
```
git clone https://github.com/abhijithkrishnan0/IllumioAssessment.git

cd IllumioAssessment; ./run.sh
```


### Program usage
The project is written in Java. The application takes in 5 arguments.
NOTE: You do not need to pass these arguments if you are running the project through the shell script.
* Batch Size: This is the number of records that will be traversed in each iteration. The default value is set to 1000
* Flowlog file: This is the path of the flowlog log file. This is stored in the project directory. The default value is "flowlog.log"
* Lookup file: This contains the path to the lookup table or the lookup csv file. The default value is "lookup.csv"
*

## Testing

### How do I know my output is correct?

### How does application scale with large files
